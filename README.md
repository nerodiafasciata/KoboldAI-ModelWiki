# KoboldAI-ModelWiki

The intent is for this repo to act as a (temporary?) repository of information about various LLMs for the KoboldAI community.

The README should contain links to wiki pages in this repository
The wiki pages should contain info about models people use with KoboldAI (and KoboldCPP).
Each model/mix should have a page. Different versions (as in revisions/retrainings/etc) of a model should have different pages, but not different parameter sizes/quants. For example, alpaca-1.1 and alpaca-1.0 should each have their own page, but alpaca-1.1-13b and alpaca-1.1-30b should not.
